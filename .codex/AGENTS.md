# ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

## Default working agreements (apply everywhere)
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Before coding: restate the goal + constraints in 3-6 bullets.
- After coding: ensure tests/lint/build run (or explain why they can't).
- Don't introduce new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Keep docs in-sync with behavior changes.

## Repo hygiene
- Add/maintain: README, docs/overview.md, docs/decisions/ (ADRs), and docs/dev-commands.md.
- If you make a non-trivial decision, write an ADR (short is fine).

## Output expectations
- Provide exact commands to run.
- Call out breaking changes and migration steps.
